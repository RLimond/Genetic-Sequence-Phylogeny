# Genetic-Sequence-Phylogeny
This repository contains a Python program that implements the Neighbor Joining algorithm to construct a phylogenetic tree based on genetic sequences. The program reads input sequences, calculates differences, and generates a phylogenetic tree representation. It provides functionality to create difference matrices, write output files, and visualize the tree. Explore evolutionary relationships among genetic sequences using this tool.
